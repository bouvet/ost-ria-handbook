# Unit testing

Testing your work, be that code or design, is important to ensure good quality in our products. There are many ways to run tests, but in this chapter we'll focus on unit tests. In our examples we'll use JavaScript and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), but these concepts can be moved to other programming languages and test frameworks as well.
